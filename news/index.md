## Upcoming events

### Steno AI Journal Club
*Date, time:* May 23, 15-16
*Location:* Skillerummet 1, Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus (see [Contact](https://hulmanlab.com/contact/) page)
*Description:* The first article we will discuss is neither about machine learning, nor about artificial intelligence. 
We will discuss the basic concepts of association and prediction which are often confused in diabetes research. 
Just read the following [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33068662/) beforehand and gather your thoughts and questions:
Association is not prediction: A landscape of confused reporting in diabetes - A systematic review by Tibor V. Varga et al.
*Registration:* Registration is NOT needed. The event is open for anyone, not just for them affiliated with Steno Aarhus.

## Insert some interesting sub-title here!

It is important for us to launch a [website](https://hulmanlab.com) and a [newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/rm/hulman-lab-newsletter), 
because we'd like to extend our communication beyond publishing scientific articles and presenting at conferences. 
We will use these channels to give a better picture of who we are, what projects we work on, and our activities 
(e.g. workshops, seminars, journal clubs, patient involment sessions).
